# LearnPEAS

A comprehensive Linux privilege escalation enumeration script designed for learning and understanding, not just finding vulnerabilities. Every finding includes educational context explaining WHAT it is, WHY it matters, and HOW to exploit it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the [PEASS-ng project](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng). LearnPEAS is an independent educational tool inspired by LinPEAS. All credit for the original PEAS enumeration framework and the exceptional work on LinPEAS goes to the PEASS-ng team. I deeply respect their contributions to the security community.

LearnPEAS is currently in active development and should be considered beta software. While functional and useful for educational purposes, features are being actively refined and expanded. The tool will continue to improve with enhanced detection capabilities, additional educational content, and performance optimizations. Feedback and contributions are welcome as I work to make this the most comprehensive educational privilege escalation tool available.

- Build mental models for privilege escalation, not just checklists

Perfect for HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and OSCP preparation.

## üî• What Makes LearnPEAS Different?

Unlike other enumeration tools, LearnPEAS doesn't just list vulnerabilities‚Äîit teaches you about them:

[LEARN] Why sudo is a common target:
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Runs with root privileges by design
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Complex codebase (150,000+ lines of C)
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Handles authentication, parsing, environment variables
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Backward compatibility = old code paths still exist
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Written in C = memory safety issues possible
[LEARN] 
[LEARN] How to find sudo exploits:
[LEARN]   1. Check version: sudo -V | head -1
[LEARN]   2. Search exploit-db: searchsploit sudo [version]
[LEARN]   3. GitHub: Search 'sudo CVE-[year]'
[LEARN]   4. Check sudo permissions: sudo -l
[LEARN] 
[LEARN] Defense (as admin):
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Keep sudo updated (sudo --version)
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Principle of least privilege (specific commands, not ALL)
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Avoid NOPASSWD where possible
[LEARN]   ‚Ä¢ Monitor sudo logs: /var/log/auth.log
```

## üéÆ Interactive Features

LearnPEAS respects your time with **skippable long-running checks**. Simply press **ENTER** to skip:

- **API key and token discovery** - Searches through /home, /var/www, /opt, /etc, /tmp for AWS keys, GitHub tokens, API keys
- **Process monitoring** - 60-second watch for hidden cron jobs
- **SUID binary search** - Comprehensive filesystem scan
- **Recent file search** - Modified files in last 48 hours
- **Credential file search** - SSH keys, secrets, password files

This gives you control over scan duration while maintaining thoroughness.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
./learnpeas.sh
```

### Enable CTF Flag Hunting
```bash
./learnpeas.sh --flags
```

**Important:** Flag hunting is opt-in only. Without the `--flags` flag, the script will NOT search for or reveal CTF flags. This prevents accidental spoilers in learning environments.

### Quick Scan (Skip Slow Checks)
```bash
./learnpeas.sh --quick
```

### Command-Line Options
```
Usage: ./learnpeas.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -q, --quick       Quick scan (skip some slow checks)
  -f, --flags       Enable CTF flag hunting (searches for and reveals flags)
  -v, --verbose     Verbose output
  --no-explain      Skip educational explanations
  -h, --help        Show help message
```

## üí° How LearnPEAS Teaches You

LearnPEAS teaches you to think like a privilege escalation expert:

### Understand the "Why"
Don't just memorize commands - understand why vulnerabilities exist:
- **Sudo misconfigurations:** Why admins grant NOPASSWD and how that breaks security
- **SUID binaries:** Why programs need elevated privileges and how that creates attack surface
- **Container escapes:** Why privileged containers defeat isolation

### Pattern Recognition
Learn to recognize similar issues across different systems:
- Identify dangerous sudo entries at a glance
- Spot suspicious SUID binaries in unusual locations
- Recognize credential patterns in configuration files

### Mental Models
Build frameworks for approaching privilege escalation systematically:
- How to analyze sudo permissions methodically
- When to check for kernel exploits vs misconfigurations
- How to prioritize findings (instant root vs requires work)

### Manual Verification
Always test findings manually - don't just trust automated tools:
- Understand what each command does before running it
- Verify vulnerabilities are actually exploitable
- Learn from false positives

```

## üìö Typical CTF/HTB Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initial foothold - understand what you have
./learnpeas.sh

# 2. Enable flag hunting to find objectives
./learnpeas.sh --flags

# 3. Review the log file to understand each finding
cat /tmp/learnpeas_*.log

# 4. Quick enumeration without explanations (less noisy)
./learnpeas.sh --quick --no-explain
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Philosophy

This tool is designed for:
- **Authorized penetration testing** - With explicit written permission
- **CTF competitions** - HackTheBox, TryHackMe, similar platforms
- **Educational environments** - Academic courses, training labs
- **Personal lab systems** - Systems you own or control

**Never run on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Full enumeration provides comprehensive coverage but takes time
- API key scanning can take several minutes on systems with large filesystems
- Process monitoring runs for 60 seconds but can be skipped by pressing ENTER
- Long-running checks (API keys, process monitoring, password hunting, SUID search, recent files) can be skipped by pressing ENTER
- Use `--quick` mode if time is critical

### Stealth Considerations
This script is **not stealthy**. On monitored systems:
- Multiple `find` commands will be logged
- Process enumeration is visible in logs
- File access attempts are auditable
- Extended searches trigger IDS/HIDS alerts

For real red team engagements, use targeted manual checks instead.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions welcome! Areas for improvement:
- Additional privilege escalation vectors
- Better GTFOBins integration
- More CTF-specific checks
- Performance optimizations
- Additional educational content
- More CVE coverage
- Enhanced container escape techniques

**Remember:** The goal is to learn and understand, not just to root boxes. Take time to read the explanations and understand why each vulnerability exists. Building deep knowledge will make you a better penetration tester.

Happy learning! üéìüîì
