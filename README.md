# LearnPEAS: Privilege Escalation In-Field Educational Tool

A comprehensive Linux privilege escalation enumeration script designed for **learning and understanding**, not just finding vulnerabilities. Every finding includes educational context explaining WHAT it is, WHY it matters, and HOW to exploit it.

LearnPEAS is an independent educational tool inspired by LinPEAS. All credit for the original PEAS enumeration framework and the exceptional work on LinPEAS goes to the PEASS-ng team. I deeply respect their contributions to the security community.

## üöß Development Status

LearnPEAS is currently in **active development** and should be considered beta software. While functional and useful for educational purposes, features are being actively refined and expanded. The tool will continue to improve with enhanced detection capabilities, additional educational content, and performance optimizations. Feedback and contributions are welcome as we work to make this the most comprehensive educational privilege escalation tool available.

Perfect for **HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and OSCP preparation**.

## Educational Framework

Unlike other enumeration tools, LearnPEAS doesn't just list vulnerabilities‚Äîit teaches you about them:

### Example: Sudo Version Vulnerability (Baron Samedit)

```
[!!! CRITICAL !!!] Sudo vulnerable to Baron Samedit (CVE-2021-3156) - Heap overflow
[VULNERABLE] sudo < 1.9.5p2 vulnerable

‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïó
‚ïë  CVE-2021-3156 - Baron Samedit (Heap Buffer Overflow)
‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù

WHAT IT IS:
  A heap-based buffer overflow in sudo that allows any local
  user to gain root WITHOUT needing a password or sudo access.
  One of the most critical sudo vulnerabilities ever found.

WHY IT EXISTS:
  When sudo processes command-line arguments, it needs to handle
  backslashes (\) specially. There's a bug in how it counts
  backslashes when a command runs in 'shell mode' (with -s or -i).

THE TECHNICAL FLAW:
  1. Sudo allocates a buffer (memory) to store the command
  2. When processing backslashes, it miscounts the length needed
  3. This causes sudo to write PAST the end of the buffer (overflow)
  4. By carefully crafting the overflow, attacker controls memory
  5. Attacker overwrites function pointers to execute their code
  6. Since sudo runs as root, the attacker's code runs as root

HOW TO EXPLOIT:
  1. Check if vulnerable:
     sudoedit -s / (if you get usage error = vulnerable)
  2. Download exploit:
     https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156
  3. Compile and run the exploit
  4. Get root shell

IMPACT: Any user ‚Üí Root, no credentials needed
```

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Educational Content
Every vulnerability type includes:
- **WHAT**: Clear definition of the vulnerability
- **WHY**: Why it exists and why it matters  
- **HOW**: Step-by-step exploitation guidance
- **Real Examples**: Actual commands you can run immediately

### High-Priority Findings with Color-Coded Alerts
- **[!!! CRITICAL !!!]** (Red background) - Instant privilege escalation paths
- **[üö© CTF FLAG üö©]** (Purple background) - CTF flag locations discovered (opt-in only)
- **[VULNERABLE]** - Exploitable misconfigurations
- **[WARNING]** - Potential security issues

### Critical Finding Types
- NOPASSWD sudo entries with GTFOBins exploitation
- Writable /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, or /etc/sudoers
- Docker/LXD/Disk group membership
- Privileged containers with escape techniques

- Writable cron directories and systemd services
- Kernel vulnerabilities (DirtyCOW, Dirty Pipe, PwnKit)
- Sudo version CVEs (Baron Samedit, sudoedit bypass, etc.)
- Container detection and escape paths

### Comprehensive Enumeration

**Core Checks:**
- System fingerprinting

- Special group membership (docker, lxd, disk, sudo)
- Writable sensitive files
- Password & credential hunting
- Polkit/pkexec analysis (PwnKit CVE-2021-4034)

**Extended Enumeration (Always Enabled):**
- Cloud metadata services (AWS EC2, Azure, GCP)
- Language-specific credential discovery (.env, package.json, etc.)
- Enhanced database enumeration (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Web application analysis (config files, writable web roots, frameworks)
- CI/CD secret exposure (Git config, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- SMB/Samba shares with null session detection
- Exposed .git directories with source code disclosure
- Apache Tomcat manager detection
- Spring Boot actuators
- WordPress extended enumeration
- Software version checking

- Wildcard injection opportunities

**CTF-Specific Features (Opt-In):**
- Flag hunting with common patterns (HTB{}, THM{}, CTF{}, flag{})
- Base64-encoded flag detection
- Flag file discovery (/root/root.txt, /home/*/user.txt)
- Environment variable flag search

## Usage

```bash
./learnpeas.sh
```

**Note:** Extended mode is permanently enabled and includes all enumeration modules by default.

### Enable CTF Flag Hunting
```bash
./learnpeas.sh --flags
```

**Important:** Flag hunting is **opt-in only**. Without the `--flags` flag, the script will NOT search for or reveal CTF flags. This prevents accidental spoilers in learning environments.

### Quick Scan
```bash
./learnpeas.sh --quick
```

### Options

```
Usage: ./learnpeas.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -q, --quick      Quick scan (skip some slow checks)
  -f, --flags      Enable CTF flag hunting (searches for and reveals flags)
  -v, --verbose    Verbose output
  --no-explain     Skip educational explanations
  -h, --help       Show help message

Note: Extended enumeration is ALWAYS enabled (includes cloud metadata, databases,
      web apps, CI/CD secrets, application services, etc.)
```

## Interactive Features

### Skippable Long-Running Checks
LearnPEAS allows you to skip time-consuming checks by pressing **ENTER**:
- **API key and token discovery** - Searches through /home, /var/www, /opt, /etc, /tmp for AWS keys, GitHub tokens, API keys
- **Process monitoring** - 60-second watch for hidden cron jobs
- **Password and credential hunting** - Extensive file searches across the filesystem

Simply press ENTER during these checks to continue to the next enumeration section. This gives you control over scan duration while maintaining thoroughness.

## Educational Philosophy

LearnPEAS teaches you to think like a privilege escalation expert:

- **Understand the "Why"**: Don't just memorize commands - understand why vulnerabilities exist
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to recognize similar issues across different systems
- **Mental Models**: Build frameworks for approaching privilege escalation systematically
- **Manual Verification**: Always test findings manually, don't just trust automated tools

```

## Typical CTF/HTB Workflow

```bash
# Initial foothold - understand what you have
./learnpeas.sh

# Enable flag hunting to find objectives
./learnpeas.sh --flags

# Review the log file to understand each finding
cat /tmp/learnpeas_*.log

# Quick enumeration without explanations (less noisy)
./learnpeas.sh --quick --no-explain
```

## Output Priority

The script produces findings in priority order:
- **[!!! CRITICAL !!!]** - Instant root or near-instant privilege escalation
- **[üö© CTF FLAG üö©]** - CTF flag locations (only with --flags)
- **[VULNERABLE]** - Exploitable findings requiring some work
- **[WARNING]** - Potential issues worth investigating
- **[INFO]** - General information about the system
- **[LEARN]** - Educational explanations (can be disabled with `--no-explain`)
- **[OK]** - Confirmations that security controls are working

## Legal Disclaimer

This tool is designed for:
- Authorized penetration testing
- CTF competitions
- Educational environments
- Personal lab systems

**Never run on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test.**

## Performance Notes

- Extended enumeration adds significant runtime but provides comprehensive coverage
- API key scanning can take several minutes on systems with large filesystems
- Process monitoring runs for 60 seconds but can be skipped
- Use `--quick` mode if time is critical
- Long-running checks (API keys, process monitoring, password hunting) can be skipped by pressing ENTER

## Operational Security

This script is **not stealthy**. On monitored systems:
- Multiple find commands will be logged
- Process enumeration is visible
- File access attempts are auditable
- Extended searches trigger IDS/HIDS alerts

For real red team engagements, use targeted manual checks instead.
